# tetris-opl
Tetris implementation in pygame, following some but definitely not all of Tetris guidelines.
Requires Python 3.x and pygame 1.9.3

# Proposed 5 Session Code
Each folder contains the potentially completed code for each session.
In the Extra's folder contains the original Tetris file that also has content not included in the session.
If students are fast leaners it is suggested to go through those concepts in the Extra's folder i.e. Displaying score and Current Level

# Disclaimer
This is used as a guide, if you would like to use the original code or other features there is other options via the branches on this Git Repo

# Credits
Please thank John for all his hard work he put into this project. Without him this would not have been possible :)
