# tetris-opl
Tetris implementation in pygame, following some but definitely not all of Tetris guidelines.
Requires Python 3.x and pygame 1.9.3

# Patch Notes 5/22
Fixed:
- added a missing block to rotation 3 of "I" block

Added:
- Lock delay

To-Do:
- Reduce lock delay while soft dropping so lock doesn't feel slow.
- Use random bag shuffle instead of pure random choice
- Next block display
- Wall kicks for nicer rotation
